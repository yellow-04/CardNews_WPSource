Photoshop-style photo editor supports layers, google fonts, photo filters, cropping, history-tracker and specific-sized templates defined by admin.

== Description ==

Digiwidgets is an online image-editor that makes it easy for anybody to add and edit images on their wordpress website. While Digiwidgets incorporates popular image-editing tools such as filters and cropping, it also has more photoshop-style features such as history-tracking, multiple layers, google fonts, and its most important feature – predefined templates.
 
The template feature is for designers/developers who create WordPress websites for clients and want their clients to be able to easily add/edit images on their website. No more distorted, squashed or wrong-sized images. With Digiwidgets, you can create a ‘template’ for each image area on a website (bio pic, header image, content slider…) so your clients can create their own images without your help and without expensive photoshop software.

1. Image templates are what WordPress has been missing! Have you ever had a client add an image to a site that was WAY too big, broke the layout, and then blame it on you? Or add a vertical image to a content slider and wonder why it’s so distorted? Clients want to be able to update images themselves. Designers don’t want to waste their time fixing what their clients break. Wordpress image editor templates are your solution.
2. Yes layers – like in Photoshop! Move layers up and down using tools or drag the thumbnails in the order you want them. Make a photo collage, add a logo to a t-shirt, add your pic to a beach background and pretend you’re there… With the WordPress image editor, the options are endless.
3. Ever wanted to ‘undo’ all the way to the beginning of a project? With Digiwidgets WordPress image editor, you can! Our ‘History’ tab tracks and time-stamps every edit over the life of a project (even beyond your last save), so you can undo to your heart’s content!
4. Sick of using the gold standard web-safe fonts offered on every other image-editor? Digiwidgets integrates with Google fonts for a vast assortment of awesome fonts that will thrill your right brain.
5. Cropping. Pretty boring feature, right? How about circle crop? Little better, eh? How about cropping multiple images within the same canvas? Now we’re talkin’. Easily create photo collages that perfectly fill your header space or blog post. Delicious.
6. Filters galore! From grayscale and sepia to brightness and contrast. From sharpen or blur to multiply and transparency. Even a ‘remove white background’ filter! Now that’s the coolest thing since… that history feature we just talked about.
